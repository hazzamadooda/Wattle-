# Software Group Project Conflict Resolution Protocol

Effective conflict resolution is crucial for the success of a software group project. This protocol outlines the guidelines and procedures for addressing and resolving conflicts within a team of four members.

## 1. Open Communication
- Encourage and promote open and honest communication among team members.
- Create an environment where team members feel safe to express concerns and raise issues.

## 2. Define Roles and Responsibilities
- Ensure roles and responsibilities are clearly defined to each team member throughout the duration of the project. 
- Minimize conflicts related to overlapping tasks by ensuring clarity in roles.

## 3. Regular Team Meetings
- Schedule regular team meetings to discuss project progress, share updates, and address any emerging conflicts.
- Meetings are to provide a platform for open dialogue and issue resolution.

## 4. Set Clear Goals
- Define project goals and objectives clearly, ensuring that all team members understand and agree to these goals.
- If a team member fails to meet the initial plan and/or deadlines, the group will discuss as to why this has occured, and the group member will either have contribution to the project deducted, or will deliver the required work at a later date (if possible).
- If a team member fails to meet the initial plan and/or deadlines due to uncontrollable events leading to a project with less progress, a tutor will be contacted and the member will be offered support and help from the other team members. This includes being sick. 

## 5. Establish Coding Standards and Guidelines
- Implement coding standards and guidelines from the project's inception to prevent conflicts related to code quality and style.
- Consistency in coding practices reduces disputes over code modifications.
- Code is to follow learned standards from the Comp2100 course. 

## 6. Use Version Control
- Version control minimizes conflicts arising from code modifications and collaboration.
- Use Git appropriately to ensure any mistakes can be easily 'rolled back'. Avoid working on the same method as another team member to ensure merges are consistent.  

## 7. Mediation Process
- In the case of a disagreement, a team leader or mediator is to be designated who can assist in resolving conflicts.
- The mediator should be impartial, experienced, and respected by the team.

## 8. Conflict Escalation
- If conflicts are unable to be mediated or discussed appropriately with the whole team, a Comp2100 tutor will be contacted. 

## 9. Constructive Feedback
- Team members are to provide constructive feedback, focusing on issues and constructive solutions.
- Feedback should be based on facts, not personal attacks.

## 10. Consensus Building
- Strive for consensus in decision-making whenever possible.
- Collaborate and work together to find mutually acceptable solutions to conflicts.

## 11. Document Agreements
- Document all decisions, agreements, and action items during meetings.
- Ensure that everyone is on the same page and reduce misunderstandings and disputes.

## 12. Time Management
- Manage time effectively to prevent stress and conflicts related to missed deadlines.
- Setting realistic deadlines and adhering to schedules is essential.

## 13. Respect Diversity
- Acknowledge and respect the diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and working styles of team members.
- Encourage an inclusive and respectful team environment.

## 14. Take Breaks
- Encourage team members to take short breaks when tensions rise during discussions.
- Breaks allow time for reflection and de-escalation of conflicts.

## 15. Continuous Improvement
- After conflicts are resolved, conduct post-resolution discussions to identify preventive measures for future issues.
- Seek ways to enhance team collaboration and minimize conflicts.

## 16. Keep Emotions in Check
- During conflict discussions, encourage team members to keep emotions in check.
- Focus on the issues at hand and avoid personal attacks or confrontations.

By adhering to this conflict resolution protocol, our software group project will maintain a harmonious and productive work environment, ultimately leading to a successful project completion.
