- General app idea discussion.
- Shift in focus to a search feature.
- Division of basic tasks.
- Privacy concerns.
- Choice of Firebase for login and data fetch.
- Unit tests for checkpoint compliance.

## Meeting Minutes
- Discussed the general idea for the app. Originally, it was envisioned as an app-analogue for Wattle. However, after reviewing project requirements, we decided that a search feature should be a more prominent and compliant aspect.
- Current idea for the upcoming week is to develop a login page. After successful login, users will be directed to a 'search' page, allowing them to search for other ANU students and find their enrolled courses. Conversely, ANU students can search for courses and find the enrolled students.
- Privacy concerns were raised, and it was decided to keep users' identity anonymous unless clear consent is provided.
- Basic tasks were roughly divided among the four group members:
  - Harry will start working on the login.
  - Douglas will begin working on loading and displaying data, in collaboration with Harry.
  - An will work on data structures.
  - Minh will begin working on data files, in collaboration with An.
- It was mutually agreed that these tasks are not strict guidelines, and all group members are encouraged to provide assistance to any task if relevant and necessary.
- Firebase was chosen for login and data fetch.
- By mid-next week, unit tests should be written (if not already) to comply with the checkpoint.

## Conclusion
- The meeting was adjourned at 3:50 pm.
