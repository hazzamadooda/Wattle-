## Meeting Minutes
- Firebase login completed, simple login page when app starts up. Currently collecting DOB, UID, and name. Will still need to collect current courses and degree as data. Maybe when searching for courses can enroll? 
- Good progress on search engine. Data structure created with UID as base for searching up users. Two search options: one for other users (in the contacts page) one for courses (in the courses page). Looking good so far.
- Started a profile page. Displays users’ UID, date of birth, currently enrolled degree, and currently enrolled courses. Can access through homepage, still need to implement functionality. Home page started as well. Need to fully flesh out UI and layout. Settings page is required as well, will start working on that soon.
- Gradle is as usual causing issues, not difficult to fix just time consuming and annoying.
